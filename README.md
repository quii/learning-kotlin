# learning-kotlin

Working through the book *Kotlin in Action*. As I learn things, write a test around it and then make it pass.

## noob notes regarding setup
- Seems like Gradle is the way to go (which i have managed to avoid so far in my career), intellij gets you most of the way, just make sure you start the project as a gradle one configured with kotlin.
